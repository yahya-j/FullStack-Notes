# FullStack-Notes

This repository holds the code for :
- fullstack-notes-application - A full-stack CRUD application with [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) as a reverse proxy.


## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the Linux Terminal.
- Familiarity with JavaScript (some of the later projects use JavaScript).

It's fine if you haven't worked with JavaScript that much. Having a basic knowledge of executing scripts with `npm` will suffice.
