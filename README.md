# FullStack-Notes

This repository holds the code for :
- fullstack-notes-application - A full-stack CRUD application with [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) as a reverse proxy.


## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the Linux Terminal.
- Familiarity with JavaScript (some of the later projects use JavaScript).

It's fine if you haven't worked with JavaScript that much. Having a basic knowledge of executing scripts with `npm` will suffice.

## Docker

Instead of writing so many commands, there is an easier way to manage multi-container projects, a tool called Docker Compose.
According to the Docker documentation - "Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start 
all the services from your configuration."
Although Compose works in all environments, it's more focused on development and testing. 
| :bell: NOTIFICATION |
|:--------------------|
| Using Compose on a production environment is not recommended at all. 
| Instead, use K8s for container's orchestration is better. |

Before you execute the command :    docker-compose --file docker-compose.yaml up --detach
Make sure you've opened your terminal in the same directory where the docker-compose.yaml file is. 
This is very important for every docker-compose command you execute.
